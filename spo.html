			<h3>Jogging</h3>
			<img src="http://www.runningforbeginners.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gravel_road.jpg" width="300" height="300">
			<p>Jogging is one of the easiest and most enjoyable ways to keep fit and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It burns calories and fat as well as boosting circulation, aiding the excretion of toxins and other waste substances from the body through perspiration, and it increases oxygen intake. 

<br><br>Jogging is a low impact form of exercise and as such, beginners are able to easily adapt to a new regime. It can be easily incorporated into a daily routine and does not require the use of a gym or expensive training sessions. Jogging can work for even the busiest of schedules.</p>

			<h3>Skipping</h3>
			<img src="http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/14-Amazing-Benefits-Of-Skipping-Exercises-For-Your-Body-1.jpg" width="300" height="300">
			<p>Skipping is no new age trendy exercise. In fact, it has been there for years now. Unfortunately, as we grew up, the rope got lost somewhere in our store room.<br> How To Jump Rope
<br>*Jump 1 to 2 inches off floor, giving rope just enough space to slip under feet — only the balls of feet should touch the floor.
<br>*Keep elbows close to sides as you turn the rope. The movement comes from the wrists and forearms, not the shoulders.
<br>*If you tire out before you finish the workout, drop the rope, but keep arms and legs going. Work up to using the rope full-time.
<br>*To find a rope that fits, place one foot in the center of the rope and lift the handles — they shouldn't go past your armpits.</p>

			<h3>Jumping Jacks</h3>
			<img src="http://www.homeexercise.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/jumping-jack.jpg" width="500" height="600">
			<p>How To Do:<br>1. Starting position: Stand straight with your feet together, arms fully extended by your sides.
<br>2. Slightly bend your knees and push through the balls of your feet and then straighten and push your knees to jump up by spreading your legs and hip wide apart.
<br>3. While performing this raise your hands up and out smoothly until your hands meet above your head.
<br>4. Final position: While returning on the ground, bring your feet together and your hands again to your sides.
<br>5. Repeat this without any pause for the desired amount of time.<br><br>The fundamental reason why jumping jacks are of benefit is that it boosts your heart rate. An increased heart rate causes the body to burn more calories and burn fat which results in weight loss. By breathing deeply while performing jumping jacks, blood circulation is improved and oxygenates your blood and muscles.</p>
